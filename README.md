## Introduction

LeetCode is a fantastic platform for sharpening algorithmic and problem-solving skills. By participating in LeetCode challenges, I aim to enhance my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving strategies.

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each solution includes explanations, complexity analysis, and sometimes alternative approaches.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Problem Name**: Each folder corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem.
  - `solution.py`: Contains my Python solution to the problem.
  - `explanation.md`: Provides a detailed explanation of the solution, including time and space complexity analysis.
  - `alternative_approaches.md` (if applicable): Discusses alternative solutions or approaches to the problem.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the solutions and explanations provided in this repository. Here's how you can make the most of it:

1. **Browse Solutions**: Navigate through the folders to find solutions to specific LeetCode problems you're interested in.

2. **Read Explanations**: Dive into the `explanation.md` files to understand the thought process behind each solution and its complexity analysis.

3. **Explore Alternatives**: If available, check out the `alternative_approaches.md` files to explore different ways of solving the same problem.
